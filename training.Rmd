## Training 

I train usually in a 4 day cycle (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday) with many other workouts in between when I get bored (mainly abs). Personally, my favorite lifts are dips and deadlifts as you can see below here are some current lifts with a 505x5 on the deadlift and 225+bw dip which comes out over 400lbs. I mainly post some of my training on Instagram as it is just easier to capture and store the videos like that. Here are a couple of some recent lifts I have done.
