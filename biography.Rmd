  <p class="title">Childhood</p>
  <p>I was born on a warm autmn day of September 9th, 1994. After awaking from my sleep, I was thrust into life against my will. So, I decided that instead of complaining about it I would try to make my life the best it could be. Over the course of my childhood I played soccer, football, was always good at math, liked history, and played computer games. Towards the end of high school, I was doing PSEO(Post Secondary Enrollment Option) which allowed me to take classes at the local community college for free. This helped me pursue a love for math and computers even more as my high school had limited offerings.</p>

  <p class="title">College</p>
  <p>Fast-foward to college, I majored in Math and Physics initially, but something happened that made me lose interest in physics. I couldn't tell you what but I just had no desire to take those classes at all. I was lost in what I wanted to do, with my focus on math being the sole thing that carried me in my studies. During that time of self-discovery I stumbled upon a book that made me see the light, it was none other than Freakanomics. This book brought to my attention the usefulness of being able to use data to convince a reader of the hypthesis in question. I was hooked. Over the next 2 years in college I continued taking math with a focus on applied math, and also jumped into economics as that was the only major that really allowed me to explore using data and math to show conclusions. </p>

  <p class="title">Graduate School</p>
  <p>Graduate school was next on the list and I knew I didnt want to attend a PhD program, but I did want to continue my quest of data science. Which lead me to the applied economics program at UND(Universtiy of North Dakota), which is where I attended undergraduate as well. This program really allowed me to jump into my data driven studies and showed me a lexicon of methods that I could use. The problem was, they used an ancient program called stata. This is a commonly used language in economics and nothing else. It is a horrible language that is also licensed. This lead me to wanting to use a different language. A better language. One where the people who use it also make the packages. This is R.</p>

  <p class="title">Professional Life</p>
  <p>in my search for a job after graduate school I started working at IBM in Rochester, MN as a Financial Data Scientist. This entailed a lot of work with financial time series data. Along with building out modeling algorithms, I had to learn how to deploy things on the cloud, using docker and kubernetes as the modalities for that. This proved to be a challenge at first, but once you wrap your head around how everything is connected you start to see how little you really know about infrastructure. After leaving IBM, I joined the contractual team at C.H. Robinson and am focused on time-series and the engineering side of things there. It is a blast. </p>
