        <p>Hello! My name is Ryan Bieber. I am a passionate web developer with a strong background in creating dynamic and responsive websites. With several years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks.</p>
        <p>My journey in web development started with a curiosity for how websites are built and a desire to create my own. Over the years, I have worked on numerous projects, ranging from small business websites to large-scale web applications. My goal is to deliver high-quality, user-friendly websites that meet the needs of my clients.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, and contributing to open-source projects. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. If you have any questions or would like to work together, please feel free to reach out!</p>
