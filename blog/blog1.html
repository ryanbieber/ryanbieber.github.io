        <section id="introduction"></section>
            <p>Well, this is a new beginning for me in taking my skills and knowledge I have gained from working at Fortune 200 companies in the data science space and bringing that to businesses who may not have the need for a full-time scientist but a partner consultant.</p>
            <p>A little bit about me and my background seems logical for a first blog post. I don’t know how frequent I will post here, but it might be a fun place to try out new technology and post about it. Hopefully, someone finds it useful.</p>

        <section id="education">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of North Dakota (UND). I continued my education at UND to obtain my Master of Science in Applied Economics.</p>

        <section id="internships">
            <h2>Internships</h2>
            <p>During my time in school, I interned at the prestigious Mayo Clinic’s SURF program in the Advanced Imaging Lab, where I worked on cutting-edge technology capable of non-invasively imaging internal organs such as the liver. I also interned at an economic consulting firm, working on class action lawsuits to determine instances of collusion and the associated damages. Both opportunities allowed me to explore my interests.</p>

        <section id="passion-for-data">
            <h2>Passion for Data</h2>
            <p>One thing that was confirmed to me is my love for working with data. I enjoy uncovering hidden solutions to problems within data — whether it’s finding ways to automate tasks or creating bots for profitable crypto trading. These challenges excite me!</p>

        <section id="career-journey"></section>
            <h2>Career Journey</h2>
            <p>After completing my education, I decided not to pursue a Ph.D. but rather to enter the workforce and apply my skills to real-world problems. This journey began at IBM, where I learned what it truly means to be a "data scientist".</p>
            <p>My experience at IBM taught me about building applications and scaling them on cloud platforms. It also led me to meet my wife, which is a wonderful bonus! I realized that being a successful data scientist requires wearing many hats: software engineer, data analyst, database administrator, machine learning engineer, and DevOps engineer. Each of these roles contributes to the overarching goal of generating insights such as forecasts.</p>
            <p>After developing my skills at IBM, I sought to learn from experts in the field, which brought me to C.H. Robinson, a logistics firm connected to nearly every company in the S&P 500.</p>

        <section id="current-role">
            <h2>Current Role at C.H. Robinson</h2>
            <p>At C.H. Robinson, I was brought on board primarily for my time-series skills and my experience in deploying applications in the cloud. As the company was migrating to the cloud during my hire, I applied my skills to help in this transition and the initial application development hosted in the cloud.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time here, I have learned best practices for building scalable applications, the importance of fail-fast strategies, MVP iterations, and the exciting emerging field of "Gen AI."</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>With over five years of experience in designing, building, and deploying applications that handle billions in freight pricing and generate valuable insights, I’m ready to leverage these skills to assist businesses that may not require a dedicated IT professional but need a reliable partner consultant.</p>
