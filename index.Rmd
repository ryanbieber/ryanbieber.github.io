My passion is using data to show how things work whether it be in the realm of predicting, forecasting, descriptive, or visualizations. Data should be used in a way that will show relationships previously unknown or prove relationships that were previously assumed. I am an avid R user and do most of my programming in that language with knowledge of many others. Using docker images that contain solutions using R as a backend environment are fairly new and extremely fun to work on. R has the ability, much like python, to deploy into clusters using [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) as a REST API or [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) as a web application. It is possible to have an entire web application be built in just R(with maybe a little html/js). Besides these, I love time-series and machine learning problems that really challenge how I think about a topic. 

I graduated from the University of North Dakota with an MS in Applied Economics in 2019 and am currently a data scientist at IBM in the finance department.

Besides spending my weekends programming, I love to spend time with my cat(click on the camera icon top right) and also train for strongman competitions(Instagram is my training log).
