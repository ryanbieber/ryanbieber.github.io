My passion is using data to show quantatively how things work wether it be in the realm of prediction or descriptive. Data should be used in a way that it will show relationships previously unknown or prove relationships that were previously assumed. I am an avid R user and do most of my programming in that langauge with knowledge of many others. I enjoy using docker/kubernetes to deploy web applications using a R backend(shiny/plumber). 

I graduated from the University of North Dakota with an MS in Applied Economics in 2019 and am currently a data scientist at IBM in the finance department.
